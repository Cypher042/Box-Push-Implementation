Box Pushing Game (Terminal Implemetation)

This is my simple implementation of the classic box-pushing puzzle game **Sokoban** using C++.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

- Move the player (`@`) using:
  - `W` â€“ Up
  - `A` â€“ Left
  - `S` â€“ Down
  - `D` â€“ Right
- Push boxes (`B`) onto target spots (`x`).
- When a box is on a target, it turns into `O`.
- Win the game by placing all boxes correctly.
- The game ends if a box gets into a deadlock position.

## ðŸ§± Game Elements

- `@` â€“ Player
- `B` â€“ Box
- `x` â€“ Destination
- `O` â€“ Box on Destination
- `#` â€“ Wall
- `' '` â€“ Empty space

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sokoban.git

   ```

2. Compile the code:
   ```bash

3. Run the game:
